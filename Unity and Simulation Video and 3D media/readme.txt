HOW TO PLAY
----------

There are a few controls for this simulator.

W,A,S,D - you will use these keys to walk around in the operating room
Mouse Left Button - this will raise your arm to the next level upon each press (must be standing still)
Mouse Right Button - this will lower your arms to the preceeding level (must be standing still)
Spacebar - this will initiate the "side stepping sequence" and attach movement to the scrub nurse at the end of the operating table
	so as your character moves, the scrub nurse will move in the opposite direction. This is to simulate passing one another
	front to front or back to back to back.

*Mouse Left Button can be used to exit "side stepping mode" (must be standing still)


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

You are a surgeon in an operating room with 4 other personnel. A computer worker, anesthesiologist, scrub nurse, and assisstant
surgeon.

There is a heart monitoring device that sits at the top of the operating table that periodically beeps.

To the side of the room is the sanitation zone and a player must move there to "re-sterilize" if they ever breached sterile field
protocols.

WHAT CAN BE TESTED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
--------------------------------------

-Surgeons and personnel inside operating rooms must adhere to strict sterilization protocols.
-Everyone must stand away from each other at least 18 inches. Anything less will be a breach of protocol
-Arms must be kept above the waist or above a 0 degree angle to the floor.
-If close by and need to walk past a tight area, everyone must move front-to-front or back-to-back for risk of
accidental contamination.
