Welcome to our team home page.

Problem Statement:
In surgery rooms, many sterile procedures must be followed in order to maintain a sterile environment for those operating in the room as well as for the patient. 
Often times, there are more than 5 people in a surgery room at a time and it is difficult to make sure that everyone is following sterile procedures, which leaves individuals to be accountable for themselves.
We look to relieve that burden with an audio sterilization assistant.
