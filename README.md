Project Description
In surgery rooms, many sterile procedures must be followed in order to maintain a sterile environment for those operating in the room as well as for the patient. These procedures include keeping the hands above the waist, maintaining an appropriate distance at times from others in the room as well as unsterile environments, and passing another person in room with a person's back facing another personâ€™s front. If medical personnel at any point leaves the sterile environment or breaks one of the three procedures above, they must leave the room immediately and re-sterilize. 
Often times, there are more than 5 people in a surgery room at a time and it is difficult to make sure that everyone is following sterile procedures, which leaves individuals to be accountable for themselves. In some cases, one person may be designated to be accountable for sterilization but this can be a hard task for one person to monitor.
We look to relieve that burden with a wearable audiocentric device that alerts those in the the surgery room when they are unsterile or simply reminds them to double check their surroundings. This device would be able to use sensors to communicate with other gowns in the room in knowing each person's location as well as the location of each person's hands in proximity to their bodies. The design of the solution below illustrates in detail how each use case will be handled.
